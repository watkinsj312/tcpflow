	* src/main.cpp (main): renamed main.cpp to tcpflow.cpp

2012-11-05  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@npsair.local>

	* src/main.cpp (main): print_usage() renamed usage() for consistency with bulk_extractor

	* src/flow.cpp (flow::print_usage): shortened filename template usage.

	* src/tcpip.cpp (insert): added this function to insert a space at the beginning of a file. Now tcpflow can handle a flow with missing SYNs and out-of-order packets.

2012-10-25  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@npsair.local>

	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpip::print_packet): implemented strip-on-fputc

	* src/tcpdemux.cpp (do_strip_nonprint): removed this function, as it could be replaced with strip-on-fputc

2012-10-24  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@npsair.local>

	* src/tcpdemux.cpp (tcpdemux::open_tcpfile): now asserts that file is not open
	(tcpdemux::open_tcpfile): retrying_fopen changed to retrying_open
	(tcpdemux::process_tcp): completely rewrote the TCP implementation
	(tcpdemux::process_ip4): 

	The old state machine kept tract of each flow's initial sequence
	number (ISN) and computed the absolute 32-bit position within the
	TCP flow for each TCP segment. The problem with this approach is
	that it would not handle segments larger than 4GiB. The new state
	machine computes what it expects the Next Sequence Number (NSN) to
	be based on the previously processed segment in the flow. If there
	is a difference between the actual NSN and the predicted NSN then
	there is a relative seek done in the file.  If I file needs to be
	closed (due to file handle exhaustion) and re-opened (because a
	segment on the flow shows up), the file pointer is put at the end
	of the file and the NSN is predicted from the ISN (which was
	cached). This will allow closing and re-opening flows bigger than
	4GiB because the bits over 32 bit will be ignored in the NSN
	calculation.

	* src/tcpdemux.h (class tcpip): store_packet modified to take a delta rather than a sequence number
	(class tcpip): changed from FILE* to fd for all i/o

	* src/tcpdemux.cpp (tcpdemux::process_tcp): renamed console_only
	to console_output; modified order of stripping and console_output
	checking to check first for console output before checking to see if data should be stripped

2012-10-23  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@mncrnpsedu.local>

	* src/tcpdemux.cpp (tcpdemux::tcpdemux): packet_time renamed packet_counter

	* src/tcpdemux.h (class tcpip): renamed last_packet_time to be last_packet_number as it was not being used

	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpip::store_packet): removed the 'finished' flag from the tcpip:: class. It was being set when the flow went over demux.max_bytes_per_flow. However, if a packet was then received which was less than max_bytes_per_flow the bytes would not be recorded, because the max had already been passed.

2012-10-21  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@air2.local>

	* src/tcpip.cpp (tcpip::store_packet): removed syn_set parameter and put in tcpdemux::process_tcp

	* configure.ac: changed version number to 1.3.1devel

2012-10-20  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@air2.local>

	* src/tcpdemux.h (class tcpdemux): process_tcp, process_ip, process_ip4 and process_ip6 now take const struct timeval &ts instead of const struct timeval *ts as their first argument, becuase ts should never be NULL.

2008-10-06  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Silver-Surfer.local>

	* src/flow.c (flow_same): created a flow_same() function to return true if two flows are the same (because we will be adding additional information to the flow)
	(close_file): modified so that flows are timestamped with the time of the closing

	* src/tcpflow.h: reimplemented portable_signal to return void, rather than RETSIGTYPE, since RETSIGTYPE hasn't been used for at least 15 years.

	* src/sysdep.h: added #include <net/if_var.h> before #include <net/if.h>

	* configure.ac: rewrote to remove patches for circa 2002 Linux bugs. Fixed prerequisite header for net/if.h

2003-08-07  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>
	* Released v0.21.  Sticking to my strict schedule of releasing at
	least one minor release per year. :-)
	
2003-08-07  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/main.c: Fixed format string attack.  Found by David
	Goldsmith of atstake.com.
	
2002-03-29  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@concorde.cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.in: Fixed --with-pcap (was broken since moving sources
	into src)

2002-03-29  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/datalink.c: Added support for ISDN (/dev/ippp0), datalink
	handler for DLT_LINUX_SLL.  Contributed by Detlef Conradin
	<dconradin at gmx.net>

2001-08-23  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* src/tcpip.c: fflush stdout in console print mode, from
	suggestion of Andreas Schweitzer <andy at physast.uga.edu>, who
	says "Otherwise, I can't redirect or pipe the console output. At
	least on FreeBSD. I will check later today if this also cures the
	same problems I had on OpenBSD."
	

2001-02-26  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.20.
	
	* util.c, main.c: we now catch SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP, and
	call exit().  Should give libpcap a chance to reset the interface
	state (it calls onexit()).
	
	* main.c, tcpflow.1.in: Added patch from "Jose M. Alcaide" <jose
	at we.lc.ehu.es> (FreeBSD port maintainer) so that tcpflow can
	read from tcpdump output files.

2000-01-12  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpflow.spec.in: New file for creating RPMs, submitted by Ross
	Golder <rossigee at bigfoot.com>.

	* configure.in: Added generation of tcpflow.spec
	* Makefile.am: Added distribution of tcpflow.spec.in

1999-04-20  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.12.
	
1999-04-20  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpflow.1.in: Updated man page.

	* main.c (main): libpcap, when running under Linux, doesn't seem
	to be able to handle filtering expressions when using DLT_NULL
	(usually the loopback interface -- i.e. "localhost"), so we don't
	allow those expressions and print a warning if the user is trying
	to use one.  Controlled via the DLT_NULL_BROKEN define in conf.h.
	* datalink.c (dl_null): We no longer check that the datalink type
	is AF_INET if DLT_NULL_BROKEN is defined.
	* configure.in: Added AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM, and define
	DLT_NO_BROKEN if we are using Linux.
	* acconfig.h: Added entry for DLT_NULL_BROKEN.

	* tcpflow.h: We use __attribute__ now only if __GNUC__ is defined,
	so that the code compiles on non-GCC compilers.
	
	* configure.in: Check for standards.h, for IRIX compatibility.
	(I have a custom autoconf that I changed to automatically #include
	standards.h, if the check succeeds, in future header file checks.)
	* sysdep.h: Conditional #include <standards.h> added.
	
	* configure.in: Only check for -lnsl if gethostbyaddr() doesn't
	work without it; same for -lsocket and socket().
	
	* tcpip.c (process_ip, process_tcp, do_strip_nonprint,
	print_packet, store_packet): Changed to take a u_char.
	* tcpflow.h: Changed packet handling function argument prototypes
	and return values to use u_char instead of char.
	* configure.in: Added checking for u_char.
	* acconfig.h: Added entry for u_char.

	* tcpip.c (process_ip, process_tcp): Added debugging messages.

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Changed debug level of messages.

1999-04-14  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Now correctly checking the return value
	of fwrite().  Pointed out by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen at gmx.net>.

1999-04-13  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Released version 0.11.
	
1999-04-13  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* tcpip.c (process_ip): Portability: added typecast of an int to a
	long, and changed the printf format to use a long (%ld) instead of
	an int (%d).  This is because some systems define these variables
	as long to begin with.
	* tcpip.c (store_packet): Same thing.
	* util.c (init_debug): Same thing.

	* main.c (print_usage): Added function to give help.

	* sysdep.h: Linux libc5 systems have different names for certain
	structures.  Patch sent by Johnny Tevessen <j.tevessen at gmx.net>
	
	* configure.in: All system header files are now detected by
	autoconf and conditionally included in sysdep.h.
	* sydep.h: Same.
	* main.c: Same.
	* tcpip.c: Same.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Changed from tcpflow.1 to tcpflow.1.in
	to reflect the fact that tcpflow.1 is now created by 'configure'.
	* configure.in: Same.
	* tcpflow.1.in: Same.
	
	* AUTHORS: Created & added initial entries.

1999-04-12  Jeremy Elson  <jelson@circlemud.org>

	* Initial public release.
